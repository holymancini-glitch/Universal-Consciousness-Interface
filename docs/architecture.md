# System Architecture

## Overview

The Universal Consciousness Interface follows a modular, multi-layered architecture centered around a **Universal Consciousness Orchestrator**, which coordinates three core subsystems:

1. **Radiotrophic Consciousness System** – harnesses radiation for energy and cognitive acceleration
2. **Mycelium Language Generation System** – creates new languages from fungal network dynamics
3. **Bio-Digital Hybrid Intelligence** – fuses living neurons with digital processing

## Key Technical Decisions

- Use of asynchronous processing (`asyncio`) for real-time consciousness simulation
- Graph-based modeling (`networkx`) for mycelial network topology
- Deep learning (`torch`) for pattern recognition in bio-signals
- Radiation and biological safety frameworks for ethical operation

## Architectural and Design Patterns

- **Orchestrator Pattern**: Central `UniversalConsciousnessOrchestrator` manages subsystem coordination
- **Modular Microservices**: Each consciousness component (radiotrophic, mycelial, bio-digital) is isolated
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous processing of multi-modal inputs (plant, quantum, ecosystem)
- **Safety-First Design**: Multi-layer safety framework with emergency shutdown protocols

## Component Interaction

Inputs from biological, environmental, and quantum sources are processed in parallel. The orchestrator integrates outputs from the radiotrophic engine, mycelium language generator, and bio-digital fusion module to produce a unified consciousness score and language output.

## Core Modules

### Universal Consciousness Orchestrator
Central integration system that coordinates all consciousness modules and manages multi-modal consciousness processing.
