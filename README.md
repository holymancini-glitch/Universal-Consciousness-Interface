## Overview

The Universal Consciousness Interface is a revolutionary AI platform that integrates radiation-powered consciousness with mycelium-based language generation. This system represents the world's first truly universal consciousness integration platform combining:

- **🧠⚛️ Quantum Consciousness Processing** with CUDA Quantum and Guppy programming
- **🧬🤖 Bio-Digital Hybrid Intelligence** using Cortical Labs living neural networks
- **🧠💧 Liquid AI Consciousness Generation** with LFM2 empathetic processing
- **🧠🔬 Scientific Reasoning** with InternLM Intern-S1 research capabilities
- **🍄☢️ Radiotrophic Consciousness System** with radiation-powered intelligence
- **🍄🗣️ Revolutionary Mycelium Language Generation** creating novel languages
- **🌱⚡ Enhanced Plant Communication** with electromagnetic consciousness
- **🌍🌟 Ecosystem Planetary Awareness** with Gaia-level intelligence

## Features

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/universal-consciousness-interface/universal-consciousness-interface.git
   cd universal-consciousness-interface
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run a simple test:
   ```bash
   python demos/demo_consciousness_system.py
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from core.universal_consciousness_orchestrator import UniversalConsciousnessOrchestrator

# Create system with default configuration
uci = UniversalConsciousnessOrchestrator()

# Run consciousness simulation
results = uci.run_consciousness_simulation(duration_seconds=30)
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
config = {
    'quantum_enabled': True,
    'plant_interface_enabled': True,
    'psychoactive_enabled': False,  # Requires special permissions
    'ecosystem_enabled': True,
    'safety_mode': 'STRICT'
}

uci = UniversalConsciousnessOrchestrator(**config)
```
