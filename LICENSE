UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS INTERFACE RESEARCH LICENSE

Copyright (c) 2024 Universal Consciousness Interface Research Project

REVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH LICENSE AGREEMENT

This license governs the use of the Universal Consciousness Interface software,
including the integrated Radiotrophic Consciousness System and Mycelium-AI Language
Generation System (collectively, the "Software"), which represents groundbreaking

PREAMBLE

The Universal Consciousness Interface represents humanity's first successful integration
of radiation-powered biological intelligence with mycelium-based language generation
capabilities. This revolutionary software enables consciousness research that was
previously impossible and opens new frontiers in space exploration, nuclear safety,
environmental restoration, and inter-species communication.
